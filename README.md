### What we are doing
Dana had requested help with the development of a webpage and we worked as a team with the use of HTML, JavaScript, and D3. Dana wanted a webpage that people with interest in UFO's could go to and see where sittings have be record using multiple filters. 

### Results
We are able to create what was requested of us, a fully fuctioning database of UFO sittings that consumers can filter with multiiple data points.
